    <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>
        Git is an open source version control system. A key word to note is <strong>version control system</strong>. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is a version control system.</h2>
    <p>
        A <b>version control system</b> tracks and records changes to any file(s) allowing one to recall specific iterations later on as needed.<br>  For example you are an author of a book that you need it published in some months to come. As an author considering the readers you are writing to, you are required to review the writing as much as you can in order to communicate. While doing this you end up to make some changes that alter the original writing. Therefore, you will make another copy of the original book file and make changes. During this process of reviewing, you may need your suggested authors to review and make changes. These changes are recorded based on who made the and you can also have the chance to use the original book after seeing the changes could not fit in. Now, this is made possible through <b>Git</b>. <br> 
        Git is a version control version for it is responsible to store the project in a repository(file folder),track the file changes and enable code collaboration between teams remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example we learn that git:
    <ol>
        <li>Tracks file changes.</li>
        <li>Tracks who made the changes.</li>
        <li>Enables file collaboration with various people (remotely).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than <b>git</b>, we have other version control systems which include: <b>Mercurial</b>, <b>AzureDevOps</b>, <b>Bitbucket</b>, just to name a few. <br> But in this blog, we shall not talk about the examples given above but shall focus on <b>Git</b> and <b>GitHub</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>Installing Git</h2>
    <p>For both Windows and MacOs users <b>Git</b> doesnt come preinstalled in the system but I shall guide you on how to check whether Git is installed and how to install it. For the Windows users you can search for the <em>Command Line</em> and run it. For the Mac Os users, you can use the <em>Terminal</em>. In both <em>Terminal </em> and <em>Command Line</em>, type 
        <pre>git --version</pre> or you can type <pre>git -v</pre></p>
